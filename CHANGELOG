		- Crop image as before (1/3 of width from chest, 1/3 of height from midline)		
		- Use slice thickness from DICOM header to position at 34 mm from phantom base
		- Perform edge search at this slice position, crop to largest speck group
		- Perform max search on largest speck group only (exclude wax edges)
	- Move nn variable to top for easy modification
	- Change results to tab delimited to facilite pasting into excel
	- Copy the results to clipboard after printing to log to reduce clicks
